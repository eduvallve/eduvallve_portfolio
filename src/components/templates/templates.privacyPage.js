            <h2>7. Transfers outside the EEA</h2>
            <p>Some third-party processors may transfer or store data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

            <h2>11. Security</h2>
            <p>I implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. However, no system is completely secure — if a breach occurs I will comply with applicable laws and notify affected individuals and authorities when required.</p>
